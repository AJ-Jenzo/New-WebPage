    <p>Below are free resourses to sites that teach computer science or coding with some having oppertunities to began building<br>
    Stuff right away and others offer job oppertunities once you've reached a certain level</p>
   
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing">Khan Academy</a>
    Khan Academy has a couple code languages and some computer courses like Computer science, It also teaches Computer animation<br> 
    with a Pixar course. The Coding laguages it has at the moment are Javascript, HTML, CSS and I think they have recently added <br>
    Python as well. They use video's as well as hands on aproach to teach you to make your own coding projects.(Grade 6 and up)
    <a href="https://allinonehighschool.com/full-curriculum/computer/">Easy Peasy All In One Highschool</a>
    Has a course on HTML/CSS with some Javascript, but also has resourses to other sites for coding.
    <a href="https://www.codingame.com/start/">Codingame</a>
    Teaches you to code while playing, moving you up the ranks where people can look at your profile and see what your skills are<br>
    as you improove over time and then you can get hired so good place for coding if your thinking about coding as a job in over 25<br>
    coding languages.
    <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">Dash</a>
    I haven't cheacked it out yet so don't know much about it, but it is a free site for learning to make websites
    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a>
    Not all their courses are for free anymore, but you don't have to pay to have acsess and can still learn from the site although<br>
    you will need to pay if you want support.
    <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30</a>
    Is more like a challenge after completing some courses, but don't know where to start, its making 30 projects in 30 days kind<br>
    of like a JavaScript boot camp.(I haven't made an account so don't know to much about it, bit the 30 day program is free so <br>
    worth checking out if you want to improove on JavaScript)
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp</a>
    Another awsome place to learn to code says its free and gives you certifacates and stuffhas helped many people get jobs so<br>
    look into it some more for job oppertunities section on my website.

    <p>There are so many awsome places and resourses I could go on forever so I need to have a better system for organizing the<br>
    info and making it easier for others to benifit and use the program.</p>
